# cpx-gradient-py
A script I made for the Adafruit Circuit Playground Express in CircuitPython over the course of three days. Different combinations of the switch-mode and buttons will create different gradient effects.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
Download colorsys.py from this repo (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Lib/colorsys.py) and place it into your lib folder on the board.
